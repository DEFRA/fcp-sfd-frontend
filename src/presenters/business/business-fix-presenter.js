 * (for example, clicking "Change business address" sets source to `address`).
 *
 * Behaviour:
 * - If exactly two sections need fixing, both are named explicitly in the text.
 * - If more than two sections need fixing and a source is provided, the source
 *   section is named and the remaining fixes are implied.
 * - If no source is provided, a generic message is shown.

 * Note: There should never be a case where only one section needs fixing,
 * as the user would be taken directly to the standard update journey.

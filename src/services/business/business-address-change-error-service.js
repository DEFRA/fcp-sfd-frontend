/**
 * Prepares page data for the business address change page when there are validation
 * or postcode lookup errors.
 *
 * This service is used when:
 *  1. Joi validation fails for the user's input.
 *  2. A postcode lookup returns no addresses for the entered postcode.
 *
 * By abstracting this logic into its own service it keeps the route handler focused on handling requests, while error
 * formatting and page data preparation are handled here.
 *
 * Normally Joi's `failAction` only handles validation errors, however postcode lookup failures are treated similarly,
 * so this service allows rendering the same page with appropriate errors.
 *

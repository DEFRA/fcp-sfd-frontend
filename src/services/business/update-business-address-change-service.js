/**
 * Prepares the address details needed to update a business address.
 * On the DAL/v1 there are two types of validation:
 *
 * 1. If the address comes from the postcode lookup, a `uprn`
 *    (Unique Property Reference Number) will be present. In this case,
 *    the only required field is the `uprn`. The rest of the address data
 *    is still included, but the DAL/v1 does not apply further validation.
 *
 * 2. If there is no `uprn`, it means the user entered the address manually.
 *    In this case, the DAL/v1 enforces validation and requires the following
 *    fields to be present:
 *    - `postcode`
 *    - `line1`
 *    - `city`
 *    - `country`
 *
 * When a user enters the address manually, the `city` is always captured
 * but stored as `line5`. We explicitly map `line4` into the `city` field
 * so that the DALâ€™s validation rules are satisfied.
 *
 * Any optional fields are written with the nullish coalescing operator. This ensures
 * that if the user does not provide a value, the field is explicitly set
 * to `null` rather than being left `undefined`.
